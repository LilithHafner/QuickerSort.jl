The method compares very favourably with other known methods in speed, in economy of storage, and in ease of programming. Certain refinements of the method, which may be useful in the optimization of inner loops, are described in the second part of the paper.}",

abstract="The recent results for merging developed by the authors are being described. Namely, it is dealt with-a fast stable merging, which works in linear time and in O(N1/2) space (N is the total number of merged items). A new algorithm for such merging is given. The version of it for unstable merging requires just O(1)-space;-a fast stable merging, which works in slightly nonlinear time and with variable workspace for merging. This algorithm is a thorough revision of that of Dudzinski and Dydek. O(1)-space version of this algorithm is discussed, too.",
