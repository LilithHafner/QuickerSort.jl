        an abstract (at most 600 characters, written in plain English with no symbol nor formula)

        references 

Compared to an extended abstract, a full paper presents more of the background and context motivating the work. It compares the work to other approaches taken in the field and gives some additional insights on the conference contribution. Use cases back up the work by showing how it can be used
